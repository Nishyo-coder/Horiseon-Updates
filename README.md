# Horiseon-Updates
## Description
This refactor was to provide my client with a cleaner and more accessible site. The motivation was to make the code more concise and reader friendly. The problem of the styling not being organized to the html has been solved along with overlapping code. 
I learned that semantics matter meaning that organizing the code into sections is incredibly important. Undoing one thing can cause a chain reaction that may get out of control.
